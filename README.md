# CryptoCoinLaundry

## INTRODUCTION:

CryptoCoinLaundry is an innovative platform that leverages the power of cryptocurrency to make laundry services more convenient, safer, and accessible. Our platform allows customers to easily and securely pay for laundry services using their crypto wallets, eliminating the hassle of managing physical coins. Additionally, we offer a unique opportunity for machine owners to earn royalties by renting out their idle washing machines and dryers to our network.

To ensure the integrity and security of our platform, we utilize the PSP34 smart contract to mint NFTs representing each washing machine. These NFTs allow for efficient tracking of machine usage and payment of royalties to the respective machine owners. The contract also includes an access control mechanism that enables the manager to manage the addition and removal of NFTs and activate or deactivate them as necessary.

At CryptoCoinLaundry, we are committed to providing a reliable and efficient laundry service that harnesses the power of blockchain technology. Join us today and become a part of the future of laundry services.
